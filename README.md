# Bar_Simulator_game
A simple Bar simulator game that uses images and sound effects made in Python using Tkinter module and with an executable made with PyInstaller, NO PYTHON REQUIRED!
I also included the CLI version and its code that served as an inspiration for the GUI version


How to run the game:
1.clone the repository
2.download files onto your pc
3.run Bar_game.py or bar_game.exe if you dont have Python installed on your computer
4. Enjoy!

Hope you enjoy and give me some feedback if you have some!
