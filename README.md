# Bar_Simulator_game
A simple Bar simulator game that uses images and sound effects made in Python using Tkinter module and with an executable made with PyInstaller, NO PYTHON REQUIRED!
I also included the CLI version and its code that served as an inspiration for the GUI version


How to run the game:

1. Clone the repository

2. Download files onto your pc

3. Run Bar_game.py or bar_game.exe if you dont have Python installed on your computer

4. Enjoy!

Hope you enjoy and give me some feedback if you have some!
